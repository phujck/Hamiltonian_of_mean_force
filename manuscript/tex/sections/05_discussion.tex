\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

We have derived an exact operator reformulation of the reduced equilibrium
object for a Gaussian bath, expressed both as a bilocal imaginary-time
influence functional and as a quenched Gaussian-field average. The nonlocal
structure in imaginary time is traced entirely to noncommutativity between
$H_Q$ and the coupling operator $f$, which forces the interaction-picture
operator $\tilde{f}(\tau)$ to appear in time-ordered products. By expanding
$\tilde{f}(\tau)$ in adjoint actions and isolating kernel moments, we obtained a
purely algebraic representation that yields an exact closure criterion for
locality of $H_{\mathrm{MF}}$.

When the adjoint-generated operator algebra closes, the mean-force Hamiltonian
is a finite operator polynomial and can be constructed via Magnus/BCH. When it
does not, any local representation necessarily involves truncation or
projection; no other approximation is introduced. Broader implications of these
results are deferred.
