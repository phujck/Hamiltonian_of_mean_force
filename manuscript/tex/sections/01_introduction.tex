\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The reduced equilibrium operator of an open quantum system at inverse
temperature $\beta$ is
\begin{equation}
    \bar{\rho}_S(\beta) = \mathrm{Tr}_B \, e^{-\beta H_{\mathrm{tot}}},
    \label{eq:intro_rho_unnorm}
\end{equation}
with $H_{\mathrm{tot}} = H_Q + H_B + H_I$ and the trace taken over the bath.
The normalized reduced state is
\begin{equation}
    \rho_S = \frac{\bar{\rho}_S}{\mathrm{Tr}_S \bar{\rho}_S}.
    \label{eq:intro_rho_norm}
\end{equation}
An equivalent operator definition of the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) is
given by
\begin{align}
    e^{-\beta H_{\mathrm{MF}}(\beta)}
    &\propto \frac{\mathrm{Tr}_B e^{-\beta(H_Q+H_B+H_I)}}{Z_B(\beta)},
    \label{eq:intro_hmf_def} \\
    Z_B(\beta) &= \mathrm{Tr}_B e^{-\beta H_B}.
    \nonumber
\end{align}
where the proportionality fixes an additive scalar in $H_{\mathrm{MF}}$.
This definition is exact and is standard in strong-coupling thermodynamics
and mean-force formulations
\cite{campisiFluctuationTheoremArbitrary2009,talknerColloquiumStatisticalMechanics2020,trushechkinOpenQuantumSystem2022,seifertFirstSecondLaw2016}.

The goal of this paper is to provide an explicit, step-by-step operator
derivation of $\bar{\rho}_S$ in a form that (i) exposes the exact
imaginary-time influence functional and its Gaussian-field reformulation and
(ii) yields a systematic criterion for when $H_{\mathrm{MF}}$ can be represented
as a local operator within a finite algebra.
Our derivation is performed in the imaginary-time interaction picture and
assumes a Gaussian bath (harmonic environment with linear coupling), for which
the influence functional is bilocal and exact
\cite{feynmanTheoryGeneralQuantum1963a,caldeiraQuantumTunnellingDissipative1983a,grabertQuantumBrownianMotion1988}.
We then show how the resulting time-ordered object can be rewritten entirely in
terms of adjoint actions of $H_Q$ on the coupling operator and kernel moments,
which leads to an exact closure criterion for locality.

No approximation enters until one projects onto a restricted operator class or
truncates an operator expansion. Broader implications are outside the present
scope.
