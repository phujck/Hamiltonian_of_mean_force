\begin{abstract}
We study the operator representability problem for the Hamiltonian of mean force
(HMF) in Gaussian linearly coupled environments beyond the commuting limit.
Building on the quenched-density construction, we derive an exact
imaginary-time reformulation in which bath statistics enter as scalar kernel
moments while operator growth is generated by the adjoint chain
$\{\mathrm{ad}_{H_Q}^{n}(f)\}_{n\ge 0}$. This yields a structural criterion:
a finite closed-form HMF exists only when the adjoint-generated operator
algebra closes inside the target ansatz. We then instantiate the criterion in a
Pauli-closed qubit model and obtain an explicit closed-form mean-force
Hamiltonian with temperature- and bath-dependence carried by mode-resolved
kernel coefficients. The manuscript is framed as the noncommuting Gaussian
follow-up to the commuting benchmark analysis of arXiv:2602.13146 and sets up
the non-Gaussian extension program.
