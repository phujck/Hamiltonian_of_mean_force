## Where we differ / what we add (standalone paragraph)
This paper provides an exact structural reformulation of the reduced equilibrium operator for Gaussian baths with linear coupling, written both as an imaginary-time influence functional and as a quenched Gaussian-field average. We then organize the operator content by the adjoint-action hierarchy and Magnus/BCH/Lie-factorization language to state an explicit closure criterion: a closed-form local HMF exists only when the operator algebra generated by repeated adjoint action of H_Q on the coupling operators closes inside the target ansatz. The analysis is anchored by minimal solvable examples (commuting coupling, quadratic/Gaussian models, single qubit), and broader implications are deferred.
