# Hamiltonian of Mean Force v2 Follow-up Framing

## Anchor Paper
- `low_temp_submission` arXiv:2602.13146 (`Mean-Force Hamiltonians from Influence Functionals`)
- Status: establishes the quenched-density representation and the exact commuting Gaussian benchmark.

## v2 Positioning
This manuscript is the direct sequel. It does not re-prove the full baseline. It starts from the Gaussian influence-functional and quenched identities and focuses on the noncommuting representability problem.

## What Is New in v2
1. Explicit sequel framing and claim boundaries relative to arXiv:2602.13146.
2. Adjoint-chain closure criterion stated as the structural condition for finite closed-form HMF representations.
3. Noncommuting Gaussian construction organized via Matsubara/kernel moments plus BCH/Magnus machinery.
4. Closed-algebra qubit instantiation with an explicit HMF expression in Pauli form.

## What Is Not Claimed in v2
1. Full non-Gaussian bath generality.
2. Full finite-dimensional classification of all noncommuting models.
3. Comprehensive numerics for the mixed noncommuting plus non-Gaussian case.

## Paper-Level Message
Paper I answered: "How do we rewrite reduced equilibrium exactly and recover the commuting benchmark?"

Paper II (this v2) answers: "Given that exact rewrite, when does a finite operator HMF exist once commutativity is dropped?"

## Proposed Section Logic
1. Introduction: sequel framing, scope boundaries, and contribution delta.
2. Model: definitions and normalization conventions.
3. Quenched/influence representation: exact Gaussian starting point.
4. Results: closure criterion and qubit closed-algebra construction.
5. Discussion: implications, limitations, and explicit handoff to non-Gaussian follow-up.

## Immediate Writing Targets
1. Finalize abstract and introduction to keep claims tightly sequel-scoped.
2. Keep citations to arXiv:2602.13146 at the motivation and discussion boundaries.
3. Ensure discussion includes explicit "next paper" scope for non-Gaussian and mixed-case numerics.
